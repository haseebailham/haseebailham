Hi, there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I'm Haseeba, a software engineer from Cambridge, MA!

I'm primarily interested in full-stack development and currently work as a Software Engineer at JP Morgan Chase & Co. I'm interested in large-scale, high-impact products.

Outside of work, I'm interested in running and roller-skating. I also enjoy playing pickleball and doing outdoor activities.
